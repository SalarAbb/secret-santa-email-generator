# secret-santa-email-generator

Go to "main_script_secret_santa.py", simply add your friends names to the players list and add their emails in the same order to the emails list. Make sure to add your own email address and 
its address. This script randomly assigns people to their secret santas and sends out an email to everyone informing who they should buy a gift for :). You can definitely change the 
email message as you would like to.
